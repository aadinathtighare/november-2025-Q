Q. 3 tier architecture we used  in real time prod env for k8s micro-services deployment ?
--> yes, 3-tier architecture is absolutely used in real-time production environments, 
even for Kubernetes-based microservices deployments, though the implementation looks a bit different from traditional VMs.
---------------------------------
Q. for front end I hv app that is service type is load balancer so top of that I hv ingress load balancer ? it is right set up  in real time prod env ?

----------------------------------------
Q. In deployment.yaml file we need to change the image tag after every build.

Not in service.yaml file ?
-->

-----------------------------------
When ever I want to do deployment I need to change the build number .
Build number is nothing but docker image tag
For every micro  service we hv different docker file
--------------------------------
