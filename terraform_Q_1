Q. i hv vpc module so that module I can use in different workspaces like dev and prod?
--> yes, you can use the same VPC module in different Terraform workspaces like dev, staging, or prod.

A module is a collection of Terraform configurations (.tf files) that define one or more resources together.
It’s like a function in programming — you define once, use many times.
You can reuse the same module multiple times with different inputs (variables).
------------
Workspaces are used for environment isolation using the same code.
--------
In many large enterprises, teams avoid workspaces and instead:

Use separate backend configurations or separate state files manually

Or even separate Git repositories per environment (e.g. infra-dev, infra-prod)

✅ Why?
Because:

They want strong isolation (no accidental prod changes)

Workspaces still share the same code and backend bucket — so a small mistake (wrong workspace apply) can impact prod.
